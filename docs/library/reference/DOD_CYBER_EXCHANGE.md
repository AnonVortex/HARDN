The Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Exchange serves as a central hub for cybersecurity information, resources, and collaboration within the DoD community. Its creation stems from the need to improve the department's cybersecurity posture by:

*   **Centralizing Information:** Providing a single, authoritative source for cybersecurity policies, standards, and best practices.
*   **Enhancing Collaboration:** Facilitating communication and knowledge sharing among cybersecurity professionals across different DoD components.
*   **Improving Compliance:** Supporting the implementation and enforcement of cybersecurity requirements, including Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).

STIGs play a crucial role in this framework by providing standardized security configuration guidelines for various hardware and software systems. The DoD Cyber Exchange offers access to STIGs and related tools, helping organizations implement and maintain secure systems that comply with DoD policies.
